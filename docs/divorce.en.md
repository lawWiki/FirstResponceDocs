# Easy way to get a divorce in India
If people think that the easiest way to get a divorce in India does not involve law or through out of court settlement, then, there is no such way. To get a valid divorce law has been involved. So, amongst all those divorce laws that have been provided with the most straightforward procedure, the easiest one is according to [Section 13B ](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/439618/)of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. As already mentioned, it is the provision of divorce sought with mutual consent. It is really important that parties have some agreements on issues because it helps the court in carrying out the divorce procedure at a much faster pace, also both the parties suffer from less emotional trauma. Having understanding on issues makes the procedure less complicated which in other circumstances is much more complicated since everything is decided by the court. There is no such provision that guarantees that the procedure for the decree of divorce will be completed  within this time limit. In some cases, it will take less time than the time taken in other cases. But the one thing that helps to get a divorce in an easy and less complicated way is the understanding of the parties on issues like, child custody, child support, alimony, etc.

Types of Divorce Petition

## Divorce with mutual consent

When both the husband and wife mutually consent to end their marriage, then, in that case, the married couple can seek a divorce from the courts. However, the court will not automatically dissolve the marriage. So that the petition for divorce is accepted, it is necessary to show that the couple has been living separately for over a year or two. 

Sometimes, a petition for divorce may be applied not because there is some problem between the husband and wife, but because of some financial problems and the couple is not able to sustain their livelihood. In such cases, the couple can seek divorce with mutual consent.

There are three aspects between a husband and a wife when they are seeking divorce:

1. The first aspect is about the minimum and the maximum amount of time which the couple need from each other.
1. The second aspect is about the matter of child custody. When a divorce is taking place by mutual consent it is up to the couple to decide as to who will take custody of the child. The custody can be joint or exclusive, as per the understanding of the parties.
1. The third aspect is related to property as to how much share of the property will husband get and what is the wife’s share in the property.

Various laws have different periods specified for the completion of procedure of divorce. According to [Section 13B](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/439618/) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955,  to initiate the divorce proceedings it is necessary that both the husband and wife must be living separately for a minimum period of one year. However, for the Christians, the period is different. According to [Section 10A](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/806295/) of the [Divorce Act, 1869](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/806295/), the couple should be living separately for a minimum period of two years. Living separately does not mean that the couple has to live at two different locations. They can be living together yet it is sufficient to prove that they were not living like husband and wife.





## Divorce without mutual consent

The divorce without mutual consent can be sought on the following grounds:

Cruelty 

Cruelty may be both physical or mental, if one of the patients feels that the conduct of the other party towards him or her is likely to cause some mental or physical injury, then, it serves as a sufficient cause to seek divorce.

Adultery

In India, earlier, adultery was a criminal offence but in a recent Supreme Court judgement adultery has been decriminalised. But it still can be used as a ground to seek divorce from a spouse who has been committing adultery. Generally, in most cases it is committed by the husbands rather than the wives.

Desertion

If one of the parties deserts the other one without giving any reasonable reason, then, it is a good reason to obtain a divorce from the other. However, the person who abandons the other spouse must have the intention to desert and have the proof for it as well. Under Hindu law, the dissertation must have lasted for at least two years, but under Christian law, there is no such time limit and a petition of divorce can be filed just by claiming that the other spouse has committed desertion.

Conversion 

Converting to another religion by a spouse is another reason to claim divorce from the other. This does not require any minimum time that has to be passed before claiming for divorce.

Mental Disorder

If the spouse is unable to perform the normal duties that he or she is required to perform due to some mental illness or disorder then, in that case, divorce can be sought. However, if the mental illness does not hamper the capabilities of the person from performing his or her duties then the divorce cannot be claimed.

Presumption of Death

If the spouse has not been heard of being alive for a minimum period of 7 years, then, in that case, the spouse who has not heard any news regarding his or her spouse being alive can seek divorce as the courts presume that the other spouse is dead.

Renunciation of the World 

If the spouse decides to renounce the world and obtains a holy order, then, the aggrieved spouse can file for divorce. However, this renunciation must be absolute and incontestable.
